## Summary

Open CS curriculums (`MIT`, `Harvard`, `Stanford`) offer deep, structured system insights — but often stay abstract.  
This log traces how they were reframed and repurposed directly into runtime product infra decisions.

## 🔁 Core System Loop

- Iterative system framing across multiple CS paradigms
- Internal loops focused on reconciling latency tradeoffs, infra composition, and modular scalability
- Structured reflection via layered feedback cycles (learning → mapping → infra shaping)

| Loop   | Action                                                   |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1.** | Extract primitives (e.g., CS50, MIT OS...)               |
| **2.** | Cross-map to infra design (e.g., ECS, Celery, Lambda)    |
| **3.** | Stress test abstraction against constraints              |
| **4.** | Compare academic vs applied mappings                     |
| **5.** | Publish synthesis (reflection, post-mortem, or protocol) |

## 🚫 Failed Loop Snapshots

| Loop | Failure Reason                                   | Resolution                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 2    | Single-queue Celery model bottlenecked under ECS | Added fallback queues + autoscaling    |
| 3    | CS50 tests failed abstraction mapping            | Switched to API contract harness       |
| 4    | Sync latency debug = invalid                     | Switched to async + traffic simulation |

## Time Snapshot

- Total Iteration: 18 hours
- Design Probes: ~27 (across 4 loops)
- Published: 2025-04-12

## ⚒️ Infra Outcomes

This log traces how primitives from MIT OS and Harvard CS50 were translated into [`⚒️ Mindframe Forge`](https://github.com/mindfforge)’s early infra:

| Concept                      | Product Reflection                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `OS kernels`                 | Latency pattern design in runtime API |
| `CS50 test scaffolds`        | Internal API validation schema        |
| `Queue architecture`         | SQS + async Celery job runners        |
| `Compute/storage separation` | ECS + Terraform config templates      |

## Notes & Future Trace Seeds

- This public log is structured for other founders/teams to fork and adapt structured learning into build-ready insight.
- Internal system traces and debugging layers are kept within the private Notion logs.
- Reflections here abstract away internal system tracebacks and architectural pivots.
- Feedback loops (internal & external) were crucial in evolving raw learning into executable infra.
- Full trace available in private Notion log (includes layer-specific iterations, thought stack re-maps, infra deltas).
