### Layer

- 🧱 `Lab Layer` → Defines card schema, symbol structure, and verification logic
- ⚒️ `Execution Layer` → Binds symbol issuance to loop trace logic
- ⚓ `Personal Layer` → Founder-operated logs for cognitive loop reflection

## Summary

This log formalizes the integration of Open Verification Layer (OVL) protocols into the symbol logic of Second Mind loop cards.

Each claim on a loop card is now validated via a symbolic signature (`⌬`, `▣`, `◉`) tied to a verifiable system loop.  
Each badge acts as a runtime marker: it exists only if supported by Logs::, confirmed via protocol trace, and reviewed by multi-agent simulation.

> Symbol ≠ style.  
> Symbol = system state.

This ensures that public claims are not narrative, but structural — grounded in reproducible execution.

## 🔁 Core System Loop

| Step   | Action                                          |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **1.** | Define system symbol structure (`⌬`, `▣`, `◉`)  |
| **2.** | Enforce symbol ↔ Logs:: binding before render   |
| **3.** | Stress test via multi-path constraint probes    |
| **4.** | Validate semantic alignment via Meta::Pattern   |
| **5.** | Confirm falsifiability & structure loop closure |

## 🚫 Failed Loop Snapshots

| Loop | Failure Reason                            | Resolution                                    |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 2    | Issued `⌬` without personal loop          | Symbol issued before trace closure validation |
| 3    | Premature `◉` issuance without agent pass | Require all-agent validation before publish   |

## Time Snapshot

- Total Iteration: \~5.2 hours
- Design Probes: \~8 (across 5 loops)
- Published: 2025-05-07

## ⚒️ Infra Outcomes

| Concept           | Reflection / Application                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Symbolic Claims` | Now require loop trace before card render            |
| `Badge Issuance`  | Gated by loop trace + multi-path semantic validation |
| `Loop Closure`    | Treated as precondition, not post-check              |

## Output Artifacts

- **Symbolic Card Protocol**
  → Layer: 🧱 Lab
  → Context: Public card ↔ log ↔ system mapping

- **Badge Verification Rule Table**
  → Layer: ⚒️ Execution
  → Context: Enforced via manual Ops; AutoSync pending

## Notes & Future Trace Seeds

- Build `AutoBadgeSync` daemon to close symbol issuance loop
- Extend badge logic into infra events & GitHub PR traceability
- Explore zero-knowledge or hash-based symbol verification
