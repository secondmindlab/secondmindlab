> Purpose: Capture when and why each folder in the Lab OS emerges — grounded in feedback loops, system evolution, and cognitive load compression.

| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/core`        | Mental models, architecture blueprints        |
| `/experiments` | Prototype systems, scaffolding loops          |
| `/logs`        | Feedback-driven iterations & records          |
| `/rhythm`      | Weekly synthesis & operating cycles           |

## Namespaces (Emergent – Conditional Activation)

| Namespace  | Trigger Condition                | Purpose                                                           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/modules` | Infra patterns become repeatable | Store reusable infra scaffolds (e.g., Celery setups, ECS configs) |
| `/scripts` | Ops workflows emerge             | Automate internal workflows (e.g., log scaffolding, deployment)   |
| `/docs`    | External surface is needed       | Write explainers, RFCs, public artifacts                          |
| `/assets`  | Visual/capture layer forms       | Store mermaid diagrams, screenshots, media outputs                |
