# 🏛 Naming Protocol Emoji

**Purpose:**

This document specifies the emoji symbols used within the Second Mind OS Lab to represent core system concepts. The aim is to provide intuitive and consistent visual identifiers for each system layer, aiding in both internal documentation and communication.

### Core Loop Layers (Canonical)

| Layer          | Emoji | Semantic Role                                                                  |
| -------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Meta::`       | 🏛     | Protocol & control plane — system governance, version diffs, structural rules. |
| `Core::`       | ⚙️    | Cognitive engine — system architecture, blueprint canon, OS primitives.        |
| `Experiment::` | 🧪    | Trial layer — forks, tests, scaffolds, runtime hypotheses.                     |
| `Logs::`       | 📃    | Signal trace — atomic system pings, observations, causal markers.              |
| `Rhythm::`     | 🩺    | System pulse — weekly state, flow blockers, continuity trace.                  |
| `Pattern::`    | 🧬    | Execution DNA — extracted schemas, mental scaffolds, feedback invariants.      |
| `Library::`    | 🗂️    | Reference base — mapped research, citations, paper distillations.              |
| `Lab::`        | 🧱    | Operational backbone of the Lab itself                                         |
| `Execution::`  | ⚒️    | System runtime, product pipeline                                               |
| `Personal::`   | ⚓    | Person ops, private loops, unmerged drafts                                     |

### Protocol Subdomains (Optional Expansion)

| Namespace    | Emoji       | Meaning                          |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| `Protocol::` | 📏          | System constraint / schema rules |
| `Fork::`     | 🌿          | Divergence, loop split           |
| `Agent::`    | 🧑‍🚀          | Cognitive actor / LLM agent      |
| `Override::` | ⛔          | Force override, protocol lock    |
| `Claim::`    | 📣          | Asserted belief or statement     |
| `Verdict::`  | ✅ / ❌ / ⚖ | Final resolution outcome         |
| `Delta::`    | 🔀          | System change or mutation        |
| `Blocker::`  | 🚧          | Flow stopper                     |
| `Resolved::` | 🛠️          | Closed loop / solved issue       |

### Log Microtags (Planned)

_(Under development for auto-agent tagging and filter system)_

| Tag          | Emoji | Usage                                   |
| ------------ | ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| `looped`     | 🔁    | Passed full cycle                       |
| `failed`     | 🚫    | Loop / experiment failed or invalidated |
| `deprecated` | ⚠️    | No longer active                        |
| `locked`     | 🔒    | Frozen by override                      |
| `flagged`    | 🚩    | Needs review                            |
| `consensus`  | 🗳️    | Multi-agent agreement                   |

### Why Emojis?

1. **Cognitive Load Reduction:** Emojis provide instant visual identification, reducing the mental load when scanning or navigating complex documentation.
2. **Semantic Clarity:** Each emoji intuitively reflects the core function or essence of the layer it represents, improving understanding and recall.
3. **Internal Consistency:** This protocol standardizes visual symbols across all documentation, facilitating clear and consistent communication within the lab and with external collaborators.

### Usage Guidelines

- **Internal Notion & GitHub:** When referencing the layers of Second Mind OS Lab, use the corresponding emoji to mark sections or actions related to the respective system layer.
- **Documentation:** Emojis should be used **sparingly** within technical documentation to enhance readability and understanding but should not overwhelm the content. Each emoji is a representation of a specific mental model or system layer.
- **Consistency:** The emoji selection is final and should not be altered unless there is significant feedback indicating a need for better representation.
